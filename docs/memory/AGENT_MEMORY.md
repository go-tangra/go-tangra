## Decisions

- [T001 claude] Pinned via `services/auth/tools/ldap.go` (`//go:build tools`, blank import), because `go mod tidy` removes a requirement nothing imports. This file isn't part of any binary.

## Interfaces

- [T001 claude] Module version: `github.com/go-ldap/ldap/v3 v3.4.14`. go-ldap's own test dependencies (gokrb5, sspi) are in go.sum but not linked into the binary.

## Gotchas

- [T001 claude] `make vuln` runs `govulncheck ./...` without the `tools` tag, so it won't scan go-ldap until real code imports it. Use `govulncheck -tags tools ./tools/` in the meantime.
- [T001 claude] `make lint` already fails with 57 findings (revive/staticcheck/gosec/goimports) in files this task didn't touch. None are in tools/ or LDAP code.
